# About

This is a collection of code I've writen for Python. The contents are based off of different sources, and so are put in their own folders. 

Below is information about what the folders mean:

  1. **OC** - Original Content. Scripts that I wrote to do a task or whatever.
  
  2. **HackerRank** - My solutions to problems in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
  
  3. **LeetCode** - My solution to problems in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

See [wiki](https://github.com/Antonio-III/Python/wiki) for code explanations. **Code explanations only exist for scripting files, where I detail how to use a particular script.** Explanations also exist in the files themselves.
