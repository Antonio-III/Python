# About

This is a collection of code I've writen for the respective language. The contents are based off of different sources, and so are put in their own folders. 

Below is information about what the folders mean:

**OC** - Content that come from the mind.

**HackerRank** - My solutions to problems in [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), though some can only be found through exclusive links. 

**LeetCode** - My solution to problems in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

See [wiki](https://github.com/Antonio-III/Python/wiki) for code explanations. **Code explanations only exist for scripting, where I detail how to use a particular script.** For non-scripts, code explanations exist in the file themselves.
